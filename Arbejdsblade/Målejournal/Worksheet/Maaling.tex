\section*{Path loss near ground}
To test the path loss near ground, the loss from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna will be measured, where the antennas is place at different heights and different distance between them. By knowing the rest of the parameters through the system, as the gains of the antennas and the transmission and received power, the path loss can be found, for the different setups.
