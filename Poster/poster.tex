\headerbox{Problem}{name=Box1,column=0,row=0}{
In the future there will be used more wireless sensor networks  to different task and many nodes in these networks, can be placed at low heights, where communication between nodes get worse, as the path loss (PL) increases as the multipath waves can no longer be ignored. This will effect the link budget, when designing the antennas.

%Maybe insert Link budget formular
}

\headerbox{PL Models}{name=Box2,column=0,below=Box1, above=bottom}{
\textbf{Friss free space PL (FSPL)}: 
The most simple PL model, that only takes into account the free space propagation and no multipath or reflection.
\begin{equation}
L_p=\left(\frac{4 \pi d}{\lambda}\right)^2
\label{simple_friss}
\end{equation}
\\
\textbf{Approximated two-ray} \\
\textbf{ground-reflection PL (ATRPL)}: 
This PL model takes into account a single point of reflection at the nearest surface. This is the approximated version, where the reflection coefficient and different gains is removed.
\begin{equation}
L_{p} = \left(\frac{d^2}{h_t h_r}\right)^2
\label{two_ray_model}
\end{equation}
\\
\textbf{Norton surface wave PL (NSPL)}: 
This PL model only takes into account the surface wave, which comes from the reflection of the surface, which absorb some of the wave and sends out this surface wave. It is only taken into account at low height, where the antennas heights is lower than $\left|\frac{\lambda}{2\pi z}\right|$.
\begin{equation}
L_p=\left(\frac{d}{\left|\frac{\lambda}{2\pi z}\right|}\right)^4
\label{surface_wave}
\end{equation}\\
\textbf{Ground wave PL (GWPL)}: 
This PL model uses concept from the other three models, as it takes into account, the direct wave, the reflected and the surface wave. It is more complex than the other models, as it needs alot of different coefficients, where some of them needs to be measured first.
\begin{equation}
L_p=\left(\frac{4 \pi d}{\lambda}\right)^2 \cdot \Big|\underbrace{1}_{\begin{subarray}{c}Direct\\wave\end{subarray}}+\underbrace{R\text{e}^{j\Delta}}_{\begin{subarray}{c}Reflected\\wave\end{subarray}}+\underbrace{(1-R)A\text{e}^{j\Delta}}_{\begin{subarray}{c}Surface\\wave\end{subarray}}\Big|^{-2} 
\label{ground_wave}
\end{equation}
\\
}

\headerbox{Test setup}{name=Box3,column=3}{
For the test setup, there are used two different set of antennas, monopole and rectangular patch, at 858 MHz. They are measured at vertical and horizontal polarization, at two different location with plain terrain (a parking lot and a school gym). These parameters do not effect the PL sizable, so the results will be taking as a mean across these parameters. \\

The measurement are made at six different distances; 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 and 30 m, and at 4 different height for both the transmitter and receiver antenna; 0.04, 0.14, 0.36 and 2.02 m. 
In each setup, there will be taking 10 measurement and taking mean of, to lessen the effect of noise.
