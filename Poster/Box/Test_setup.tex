A measurement campaign were designed with the following parameters.
\begin{itemize}%\itemsep0em
\item 1 Frequency (858 MHz)
\item 2 Antenna sets (monopole and patch)
\item 2 Polarization (horizontal and vertical)
\item 2 Location (outdoor and indoor)
\item 4 Rx/Tx heights (from 0.04 to 2.02 m)
\item 6 Distances (from 1 to 30 m)
\end{itemize}
The mean of 10 measurements were found in each point to lessen the effect of uncertainties. %The used setup was:
