The study found that the GWPL was the best method to predict the PL, however the value of the surface constant was needed to be complex and therefore hard to determine. The accuracy of the PL models was found to:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Models} & \textbf{MSE} & \textbf{Applicability} \\ \hline
FSPL            & 15.95        & 35 \%                  \\ \hline
ATRPL 		    & 141.58       & 65 \%                  \\ \hline %approx.
%TRPL     		& 42.12        & 100 \%                 \\ \hline
GWPL            & 35.49        & 100 \%                 \\ \hline
NSPL            & 230.05       & 30 \%                  \\ \hline
PPL            & 60.18        & 65 \%                  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


The PPL also uses the same surface constants as the GWPL. However, only the magnitude of it is needed and it is therefore easier to find. A change in value give rise to a offset in the predicted PL.
