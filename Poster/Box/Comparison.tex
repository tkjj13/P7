The study found that the GWPL was the best method to predict the PL, it is also the most complex model and needs a measurement of the surface constant. The accuracy of the PL models was found to:

\end{tabular}

The PPL also uses the same surface constants as the GWPL. However, not all constants are needed and PPL is more simple to calculate. A change in the surface constant \textit{z} value, gives rise to a offset in the predicted PL.
