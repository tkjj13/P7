In terms proposing a PL model all six parameters from the measurement campaign have been considered. In Appendix it is shown that the distance and heights are very influential and should therefore form the base of the proposed model. %This is in expected as only the NSPL has some dependency on polarization and environment. 
The proposed model is designed around the existing models as the theory for those is still firm. The aim is therefore to make a model that is more simple than the GWPL model, but has high applicability and high accuracy. The base of the model is the TRPL as it already has high applicability and simple structure. The weak point here is it inaccuracy at very low heights which could be accommodated by adding the NSPL. 

\begin{align}
Proposed\; model = TRPL + NSPL \\
P_r = \frac{P_t G_t G_r }{L}\left(\frac{h_t^2 h_r^2+h_0^4}{d^4}\right)
\end{align}

This model still suffer from the weak point of NSPL's dependency upon $z$. However as only the magnitude of $z$ is needed this can be guestimated in most cases and in more critical cases it can be measured using the method described in \cite{Kim}. From our measurement the average magnitude of $z$ across environment and polarization is 0.8122. To find out the performance of the model it is compared to the other models using this average of $z$. First to analyse the applicability of the model it has the same applicability as the TRPL model which means it can be used if \eqref{two_ray_cond} is true else FSPL should still be used.

The accuracy is found on the same data set as the other models as none of the data points have been used for the derivation of any part of the model. The MSE is found to 87.66. Which is significantly lower than either TRPL or NSPL, it can therefore be concluded that the weak point of the TRPL at very low TX and/or Rx heights has been strengthened, the same can be said for the NSPL where the applicability has been greatly extended, the performance at low height is still affected by the magnitude of $z$ as seen in \autoref{ourModel1}. However as the heights increases the dependency of $z$ lessen and the model is almost equal to TRPL as seen no \autoref{ourModel2}. The model does still not perform as well as the GWPL, however that could not be expected.

%The reasoning behind adding exactly these two models is that the TRPL and NSPL overlap each other, given there conditions, where if the purposed model included FSPL, then the TRPL is not valid where FSPL is valid. 

%both takes into account the direct and reflected wave, while the NSPL, takes into account the surface wave. This is given for the conditions that the two models have to uphold \eqref{cond_surface}, \eqref{two_ray_cond}.

%As both the TRPL and NSPL have their conditions these same conditions will be applied to the our purposed model. 
%When comparing the MSE and coverage are of our purposed model and the GRPL, where the MSE of our purposed model is 65.42, while the coverage is 65.00$\%$. The MSE of the GRPL is still better.  \\


%The measurements at the smallest distances between the transmitter and the receiver, will suffer from not being in the Far Field, this could indicate why some of the measurements behave as they do. \\

%Also other measurements at different distances have a weird jump this could involve an environmental factor, as also the measurments have been done over three days, at the parking lot.
