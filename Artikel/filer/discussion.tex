In terms proposing a PL model all six parameters from the measurement campaign have been considered. From \autoref{App1} and \autoref{App2} it is shown that the distance and heights are very influential and should therefore form the base of the proposed model and from \autoref{App3} it can be seen that the other parameters might be left out. %This is in expected as only the NSPL has some dependency on polarization and environment. 
The proposed model is designed around the existing models, as the theory for those are still firm. The aim is therefore to make a model that is simple, compared to the GWPL model, but has high applicability and high accuracy compared to the other PL models. 


The base of the model is chosen to be the ATRPL as it already has the highest applicability of the models except for the GWPL and a simple structure compared to the GWPL. The weak point in the ATRPL is its inaccuracy at very low heights which is a problem as the focus are near-ground scenarios. This could be compensated by the NSPL, the reasoning behind this is that NSPL accounts for the surface wave part that has been set to zero in the approximation of the ATRPL. Together these model will account for the all three waves in the GWPL. These can however not be simply added together as it is the power of the waves that can be added and not the respective PL. To find the predicted $P_r$ from the models, \eqref{two_ray_model} and \eqref{surface_wave} are inserted into \eqref{link_bud} and added finally the PL is isolated again. A more simple way to express this is seen in \eqref{proposedModel1}.
\begin{align}
Proposed\; PL\; model &= \left(ATRPL^{-1} + NSPL^{-1}\right)^{-1} \label{proposedModel1}\\
L_p &= \frac{d^4}{h_t^2 h_r^2+h_0^4} \label{proposedModel2}
\end{align}

This model still suffers from the weak point of NSPL's dependency upon $z$ which is expressed in \eqref{h_0}. However, as only the magnitude of $z$ is needed this can be guestimated in most cases and in more critical cases it can be measured using the method described in \cite{Kim}. From the measurements the average magnitude of $z$ across environment and polarization is 0.8122. To find out the performance of the model it is compared to the other models using this average of $z$. First to analyse the applicability of the model it has the same applicability as the ATRPL model which means it can be used if \eqref{two_ray_cond} is true else FSPL should still be used. This can be seen from \autoref{ourModel2} and \autoref{Models62} as the intersection between the two aforementioned models.

The accuracy is found on the same data set as the other models as none of the data points have been used for the derivation of any part of the model. The MSE is found to 87.66, which is significantly lower than either ATRPL or NSPL. It can therefore be concluded that the weakness of the ATRPL at very low Tx and/or Rx heights has been strengthened. The same can be said for the NSPL where the applicability has been greatly extended, the performance at low heights is still affected by the magnitude of $z$ as seen in \autoref{ourModel1}. However, as the heights increases the dependency of $z$ lessen, as the contribution from the NSPL part becomes smaller. This can be seen as the model is almost equal to the ATRPL on \autoref{ourModel2} and \autoref{Models62}.  The model does still not perform as well as the GWPL, however that could not be expected, as the proposed model still uses approximations and simplifications. However, with a better estimate of $z$ the model might fit better with low Tx and Rx heights which can be seen on \autoref{Modelzadjust}.

%The reasoning behind adding exactly these two models is that the TRPL and NSPL overlap each other, given there conditions, where if the purposed model included FSPL, then the TRPL is not valid where FSPL is valid. 

%both takes into account the direct and reflected wave, while the NSPL, takes into account the surface wave. This is given for the conditions that the two models have to uphold \eqref{cond_surface}, \eqref{two_ray_cond}.

%As both the TRPL and NSPL have their conditions these same conditions will be applied to the our purposed model. 
%When comparing the MSE and coverage are of our purposed model and the GRPL, where the MSE of our purposed model is 65.42, while the coverage is 65.00$\%$. The MSE of the GRPL is still better.  \\


%The measurements at the smallest distances between the transmitter and the receiver, will suffer from not being in the Far Field, this could indicate why some of the measurements behave as they do. \\

%Also other measurements at different distances have a weird jump this could involve an environmental factor, as also the measurments have been done over three days, at the parking lot.
