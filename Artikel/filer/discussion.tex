 The aim is therefore to make an simple model, that involves the simplified PL models, which do not require complex data processing. However when using the surface wave model \eqref{surface_wave} it is necessary to make measurements to find $z$, the aim is then to make an table of $z$ values. As the simplified models have there conditions these same conditions will be applied to our model \\


%The measurements at the smallest distances between the transmitter and the receiver, will suffer from not being in the Far Field, this could indicate why some of the measurements behave as they do. \\

%Also other measurements at different distances have a weird jump this could involve an environmental factor, as also the measurments have been done over three days, at the parking lot.
