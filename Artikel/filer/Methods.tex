A experiential method will be used to make model, that will be used to calculated the loss for near ground communication. This model will be based on data gathered from measure the path loss at different heights and distance. In each point there will be take multiple measurements, so the noise factor will effect less on the results.

To testing, there will be used five sets of antennas, two sets monopole antennas (858 MHz and 2590 MHz), two sets patch antennas (858 MHz and 2590 MHz) and one sets demo boards (858 MHz). By using two different sets of antennas and frequencies,  it can be taken into account, when the model is made. There will also be tested with horizontal and vertical polarization, to see if this will effect the model. The testing will take place at two locations, outside on a empty parking lot and inside a gym (x by x meters). Two locations is used, to see if the model works at two different locations.
