A experiential method based on measurements is used to make the PL model, that will be used to calculated the loss for near ground communication. This model is based on data gathered from measuring the path loss at different heights and distances. In each point there will be take multiple measurements, so the noise factor will effect less on the results.

During testing, five sets of antennas are used, two sets monopole antennas (858 MHz and 2590 MHz) two sets patch antennas (858 MHz and 2590 MHz) and one demo board set (858 MHz). By using two different sets of antennas and frequencies,  it can be taken into account, when the model is made. There will also be tested with horizontal and vertical polarization, to see if this will effect the model. The testing will take place at two locations, outside an empty parking lot and inside a gym (x by x meters). Two locations is used, to see if the model works at two different locations.
