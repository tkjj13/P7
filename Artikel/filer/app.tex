The results from the measurement campaign is analysed to determine influence of the different test parameters. According to the 95\% confidence interval, when changing the distance from one measurement point to the next, there is an increase in PL of more than 6 dB across all distances point, which is shown in \autoref{App1}.

\label{App1}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Distance    & 1 m & 2 m& 4 m\\\hline
PL & (34.68$\pm 0.5$) dB & (41.37$\pm 0.5$) dB & (49.02$\pm 0.5$) dB  \\\hline
\multicolumn{4}{c}{}\\\hline

PL &	(57.29$\pm 0.5$) dB & (66.14$\pm 0.5$) dB & (72.29$\pm 0.5$) dB \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



In \autoref{App2}, the mean PL across all height setups is shown. It is seen that, at lower heights, the PL increases.

\end{table}


The rest of the test parameters (Environment, Antenna type and Polarization) impact is seen in \autoref{App3}. 

\begin{table}[H]

\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline 
\multicolumn{2}{|c}{Environment} & \multicolumn{2}{|c}{Antenna type} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Polarization}\\\hline
Gym & (2.23$\pm 0.5$) dB & Monopole & (4.18$\pm 0.5$) dB &Vertical & (3.32$\pm 0.5$) dB \\\hline
Parking lot & (2.23$\pm 0.5$) dB & Patch & (4.18$\pm 0.5$) dB &Horizontal & (3.32$\pm 0.5$) dB \\\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}


It should be noted that even though there only are a minimum of two setups tested for each parameter, these setups are quite different, so if the parameters have any influence on the PL, it should be apparent. 






%This is expected for the placement and antenna type parameters, as the antenna type should not effect the PL, and the differences for the placements is found in the reflection, which have been taking into consideration for each placement. The polarization is also taking into consideration with the reflection and the antenna gains.
