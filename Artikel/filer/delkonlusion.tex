\subsection{Important points}
The ideal PL model is the ground wave PL model \eqref{ground_wave_EE0} and also the most complex, as it requires to make measurements at desired locations, and requires rather complex data processing. The complexity of the ground wave model \eqref{ground_wave_EE0}, is mostly due to the Complex relative permittivity $\epsilon_{0}$ \eqref{eps_0}. In order to find $\epsilon_{0}$ it is required to make three measurements at three different heights and distances, where the angle is the same, this will give three circles, after more data processing where the crossing point between all of the three circles will give $\epsilon_{0}$.  \\

The three approximated models of the ground wave model,
