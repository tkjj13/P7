\subsection{Important points}
The ideal PL model is the GWPL PL model \eqref{ground_wave} and also the most complex, as it requires to make measurements at desired locations, and requires rather complex data processing. The complexity of the GWPL model \eqref{ground_wave}, is mostly due to the Complex relative permittivity $\epsilon_{0}$. In order to find $\epsilon_{0}$ it is required to make  measurements. As it can be seen from the \autoref{my-label}

It is also important to note that the three approximated models of the GWPL \eqref{simple_friss}\eqref{two_ray_model}\eqref{surface_wave}, which are based on the GWPL model \eqref{ground_wave} are PL models that can be applied, and will have the same effect as the the GWPL PL model, and are more simple to apply. Although the surface wave model is based on the parameter $z$, which requires the same measurements as $\epsilon_{0}$.
