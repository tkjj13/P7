\subsection{Important points}
The ideal PL model is the ground wave PL model \eqref{ground_wave_EE0} and also the most complex, as it requires to make measurements at desired locations, and requires rather complex data processing. The complexity of the ground wave model \eqref{ground_wave_EE0}, is mostly due to the Complex relative permittivity $\epsilon_{0}$ \eqref{eps_0}. In order to find $\epsilon_{0}$ it is required to make three measurements at three different heights and distances, where the angle is the same, this will give three circles, the value for $\epsilon_{0}$ is found after more data processing where the crossing point between all of the three circles will give $\epsilon_{0}$.  \\

It is also important to note that the three approximated models of the ground wave model \eqref{simple_friss}\eqref{two_ray_model}\eqref{surface_wave}, which are based on the ground wave PL model \eqref{ground_wave_EE0} are PL models that can be applied, and will have the same effect as the the ground wave PL model, and are more simple to apply. Although the surface wave model is based on the parameter $z$, which requires the same measurements as $\epsilon_{0}$.
