\subsection{Method}
To solve a problem like this there is generally two types of approaches a theoretic approach where the models are derieved using physics and electromagnetism and an experimental approach where the PL is measured and a model is fitted to the data. This article will focus on validation of existing models using experiments. 

The validation will be made over multiple steps, the first is to assume no knowledge of existing model and design a measurement campaign which accounts for all possible parameters that might affect the PL. The next step is to try and exclude parameters that have little to no statistical influence on the PL. Lastly the data will be matched with the data to verify if the model predicts the PL within an acceptable margin.
