\subsection{Model estimation}

As it is seen from the figures \autoref{Models1}, \autoref{Models7}, \autoref{Models10}, the different models, besides GWPL, have different areas where they are accurate, will having other areas, where they either over and underestimate the PL. To make a fair comparison of their accuracy, there will taken a mean square error (MSE) over the areas, where the conditions for the different models is for filled.




%Conditions
%GWPL = none
%TRPL = (virker bedst ved hÃ¸jde over lambda)
%TRPL approx = d > dc = (4 pi ht hr)/lambda
%NSPL = h < lambda
%FSPL = no multipath
