In the future it is likely that more and more wireless sensor networks (WSN) will appear. Many of such networks may be placed close to or directly in the ground for instance to monitor traffic flow or home power consumption examples could also include industrial or military uses. In such networks both power efficiency as well as reliability is key. To estimates those a reliable model for the path loss (PL) is needed. When placing the antenna so close to the ground a few problems occur, these problems still needs to be investigated further to effectively estimate the PL. Many of the earliest works only focus on frequencies below 30 MHz \cite{Bullington}, and states that the complexity increases as frequency increases. 


%The problem about calculating the path loss for antennas located near ground has been looked on.
