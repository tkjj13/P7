In the future it is likely that more and more wireless sensor networks (WSN) will appear. Such WSNs could be used to monitor traffic flow or home power consumption. Examples could also include industrial or military uses. Many of such sensor nodes may be placed close to or directly on the ground. An example is to monitor the traffic flow, where sensors could be placed on ground level. In terms of military uses, sensors could also be placed at ground level at different locations to detect incoming enemies, where all of these sensors will have to report back to the base station, if enemies are near. In such networks both power efficiency as well as reliability is key to maximise the performance. To estimate those, a reliable model path loss model (PL) is needed.
There are multiple models made for low height PL, but many of the earliest works only focus on frequencies below 30 MHz \cite{Bullington}, and states that the complexity increases as frequency increases. Most of the more recent works focus only on equal height for receiver and transmitter or neglect a verification of the purposed model. 


%The problem about calculating the path loss for antennas located near ground has been looked on.
