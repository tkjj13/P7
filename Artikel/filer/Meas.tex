\section{Results}
%\vspace{-1em}
The results from the measurement campaign have been analysed, which can be seen in Appendix. The result of this is shown in \autoref{App1}, \autoref{App2} and \autoref{App3}, where it can be seen that the environment, antenna type and polarization are less influential parameters (LIP). %, which is the placement, antenna type and polarization. 
That makes it possible to take the mean across the LIP, and focus only on the different combinations of height and distances. To show the findings of the measurement campaign, \autoref{Meas1} shows PL at equal height of the receivers and different distances, \autoref{Meas2} shows PL with an Rx height of 0.04 m varying the Tx height and the distance, \autoref{Meas3} shows PL at with an Rx height of 2.02 m varying the Tx height and the distance, in all cases a mean has been taken across the LIP. 


%It is seen on \autoref{Meas1}, that the longer the distance, the higher the PL. This comes from the same principle, that the FSPL model is based on, which is given as signal = $\frac{1}{d^{2}}$, this means that the larger the distance the less signal is obtained, and more PL loss. When looking at the graph compared to changing the heights, it is seen, that the lower the antennas is placed, the higher PL. This comes from the principle, that reflections comes from the ground and comes with (in most cases) destructive interference, which the TRPL model is based on. 

%Secondly there will be looked at the case, where the height of the transmitting antenna is kept at a single height, both low at 0.01m \autoref{Meas2} and high at 2.00m \autoref{Meas3}, while the height of the receiving antenna is varying.

\end{figure}

%In both cases, it is seen that the lower the heights of the antennas is, the higher the PL. Some of the measurements are very close at the short distance on \autoref{Meas3}. This comes from the destructive interference, that comes at different angles. As the different heights of the receiver antenna gives different angles, where the difference is much higher close by the transmitter antenna, the difference in destructive interference is larger and the measurements get closer to each other.

The measured PL, where the mean across LIP again has been taken, is now compared to predictions of the models described earlier, to see if the models predict the PL accurately, this is done at selected heights of the transmitting and receiving antenna, as seen on \autoref{Models1}, \autoref{Models7} and \autoref{Models10}.\\

On \autoref{Models1} it can be seen that GWPL and NSPL predicts the PL best, as expected due to the conditions of the PL models, however both PL models overestimate the PL by close around 10 dB, which could indicate that the measurements of $\epsilon_0$ might not be completely accurate, as it occurs in both PL models. Here the general problem with low height is also seen as FSPL greatly underestimate the PL where TRPL greatly overestimate the PL.

\label{Models7}
\end{figure}

On \autoref{Models7} it can be seen that GWPL predicts the path loss across all distances, where the predictions from FSPL and TRPL crosses at a distance which matches the condition mentioned in \eqref{two_ray_cond}. The NSPL greatly overestimate the PL which is expected since \eqref{cond_surface} is not true.

\input{figures/Models10.tex}
\caption{Comparison between measured PL and predicted PL from models at a height of 2.00 m for both Tx and Rx.}
\label{Models10}
\end{figure}

On \autoref{Models10} it can be seen that GWPL together with the FSPL predicts the path loss across all distances, where the predictions from TRPL is underestimating the path loss which is because \eqref{two_ray_cond} is false. The NSPL greatly overestimate the PL which is expected since \eqref{cond_surface} is not true.\\



As it is seen from the figures \autoref{Models1}, \autoref{Models7}, \autoref{Models10}, the different models, besides GWPL, have different areas where they are accurate, while having other areas, where they either over or underestimate the PL. To compare the different models accuracy the mean square error (MSE) is calculated based on the measured PL. To make this estimate valid it is necessary to work only inside the valid regions of the different models, which is found based on \eqref{two_ray_cond} and \eqref{cond_surface}.
