\section{Discussion}
This section contains the discussion about the results compared to the parameters and the exiting PL models, ending by proposing a new PL model.

\subsection{Less influential parameters}

So from the analysis of the test parameters, it is seen that only the distance between the antennas and the heights of antennas has a influence that exceeds 5 dB. By that account the other parameters are deemed to be less influential parameters (LIP). Because of this the sample mean can be taken across these parameters. This is in accordance with PL models where only the GWPL and to some extent the NSPL take the environment and polarization into account.



% which can be seen in Appendix. The result of this is shown in \autoref{App1}, \autoref{App2} and \autoref{App3}, where it can be seen that the environment, antenna type and polarization are less influential parameters (LIP). %, which is the placement, antenna type and polarization. 
%That makes it possible to take the mean across the LIP, and focus only on the different combinations of height and distances. To show the findings of the measurement campaign, \autoref{Meas1} shows PL at equal height of the receivers and different distances, \autoref{Meas2} shows PL with an Rx height of 0.04 m varying the Tx height and the distance, \autoref{Meas3} shows PL at with an Rx height of 2.02 m varying the Tx height and the distance, in all cases a mean has been taken across the LIP. 


%It is seen on \autoref{Meas1}, that the longer the distance, the higher the PL. This comes from the same principle, that the FSPL model is based on, which is given as signal = $\frac{1}{d^{2}}$, this means that the larger the distance the less signal is obtained, and more PL loss. When looking at the graph compared to changing the heights, it is seen, that the lower the antennas is placed, the higher PL. This comes from the principle, that reflections comes from the ground and comes with (in most cases) destructive interference, which the TRPL model is based on. 

%Secondly there will be looked at the case, where the height of the transmitting antenna is kept at a single height, both low at 0.01m \autoref{Meas2} and high at 2.00m \autoref{Meas3}, while the height of the receiving antenna is varying.

%In both cases, it is seen that the lower the heights of the antennas is, the higher the PL. Some of the measurements are very close at the short distance on \autoref{Meas3}. This comes from the destructive interference, that comes at different angles. As the different heights of the receiver antenna gives different angles, where the difference is much higher close by the transmitter antenna, the difference in destructive interference is larger and the measurements get closer to each other.

\subsection{Comparison and coverage of exiting PL models}

The measured PL is now compared to the models described earlier, to see if the models predict the PL accurately according to their coverage area\footnote{The coverage area is here defined as the part of the measurement campaign which fulfils the condition for the individual models.}. This is done at all height combinations and selected combinations can be seen on \autoref{Models1}, \autoref{Models6}, \autoref{Models7} and \autoref{Models10}.

On \autoref{Models1} it can be seen that GWPL and NSPL predicts the PL best, as expected due to the measured points being inside the coverage area of these PL models. However both PL models overestimate the PL by around 10 dB, which could suggest that the measurements of $\epsilon_0$ might not be completely accurate, as it occurs in both PL models. The procedure to determine $\epsilon_0$ is described in \cite{Kim}, a few inconsistencies occurred when calculating $\epsilon_0$ which further supports that it might be inaccurate. A problem occurring at low heights is that ATRPL greatly overestimates the PL, even though the measured points are inside its coverage area. The FSPL underestimates the PL as expected as none of the points are inside its coverage area.

On \autoref{Models6} and \autoref{Models7} it can be seen that GWPL predicts the PL across all distances, where the predictions from FSPL and ATRPL crosses at a distance which matches the condition mentioned in \eqref{two_ray_cond}. The NSPL greatly overestimates the PL which is expected since the measured points are outside its coverage area.\\

On \autoref{Models10} it can be seen that GWPL together with the FSPL predicts the PL across all distances, but as it can also be seen the GWPL predicts ripples, the reason being the interference between the direct and reflected wave components. The predictions from ATRPL and NSPL is underestimating and overestimating the PL respectively as expected from their coverage areas.

To compare the different models accuracy the mean square error (MSE) is calculated based on the measured PL. To make this estimate valid it is of course necessary to work only inside the coverage area of the different PL models.
