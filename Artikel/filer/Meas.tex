From the analyse of the results of the measurements in Appedix XX, it is shown, that the height of the antennas and the distance between them have a much higher influence on the PL, than the other parameter, which is the placement, antenna type and polarization. As these parameters have much less influence on the PL, there will only be looking at the different height combinations and distance between the antennas.

Firstly there will be looked at the case, where the height of the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna is at the same heights, over the different distance.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\input{figures/xTox.tex}
\caption{Mesurements of PL for transmitter and receiver antenna at the same height.}
\label{Meas1}
\end{figure}

It is seen on figure \ref{Meas1}, that the longer the distance, the higher the PL. This comes from the same principle, that the Friss model is based on. When looking at the graph compared to changing the heights, it is seen, that the lower the antennas is placed, the higher PL. This comes from the principle, that reflections comes from the ground and comes with (in most cases) destructive interference, which the Two Ray model is based on. 

Secondly there will be looked at the case, where the height of the transmitting antenna is kept at a single height, both low at 0.01m (Figure \ref{Meas2}) and high at 2.00m (Figure \ref{Meas3}), while the height of the receiving antenna is varying.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\input{figures/LowTox.tex}
\caption{Mesurements of PL for transmitter at 0.01m and receiver antenna at varying heights}
\label{Meas2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\input{figures/HighTox.tex}
\caption{Mesurements of PL for transmitter at 2.00m and receiver antenna at varying heights}
\label{Meas3}
\end{figure}

In both cases, it is seen that the lower the heights of the antennas is, the higher the PL. Some of the measurements are very close at the short distance on figure \ref{Meas3}. This comes from the destructive interference, that comes at different angles. As the different heights of the receiver antenna gives different angles, where the difference is much higher close by the transmitter antenna, the difference in destructive interference is larger and the measurements get closer to each other.

Lastly there will make a comparison of the measured data and the model described earlier, to see if the model estimated the measured data correctly.
